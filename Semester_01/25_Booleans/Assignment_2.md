### Assignment 2: Simplified Blackjack Game

In this assignment, you will simulate a very basic version of a Blackjack game. The player will be dealt two cards, and the goal is to check if the player's total is less than or equal to 21.

**Instructions:**
- Assign two integer values to represent the two cards from the input function.
- Use a relational operator to check if the sum of the two cards is less than or equal to 21.
- Print the result (either `True` or `False`).
