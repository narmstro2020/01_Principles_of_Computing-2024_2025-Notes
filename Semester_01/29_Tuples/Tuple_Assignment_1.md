# Assignment 1: Tuple Basics and Manipulation

## Instructions

1. **Tuple Creation and Indexing**
   - Create a tuple named `fruit_tuple` with the following elements: `"apple"`, `"banana"`, `"cherry"`, `"date"`.
   - Print the first and last elements of `fruit_tuple` using indexing.
   - Using slicing, create a new tuple `slice_tuple` containing only the second and third elements of `fruit_tuple` and print it.

2. **Tuple Methods**
   - Create a tuple named `num_tuple` with the values `(3, 5, 3, 2, 8, 3, 7)`.
   - Use the `count()` method to count how many times the number `3` appears in `num_tuple`.
   - Use the `index()` method to find the position of the first occurrence of the number `8` in `num_tuple`.

3. **Tuple Unpacking**
   - Create a tuple called `person_info` with the values `"Alice"`, `28`, `"Engineer"`.
   - Unpack this tuple into three variables: `name`, `age`, and `profession`.
   - Print each variable to confirm the values were unpacked correctly.

**Submission**: Write a Python script that performs all tasks above and add comments explaining each step.
