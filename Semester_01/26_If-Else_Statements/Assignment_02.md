**Objective:** Practice using `if-else` statements by creating a program that calculates letter grades based on numeric input.

## Instructions:

1. Write a Python program that takes a score between 0 and 100 as input.
2. The program should assign a letter grade using the following criteria:
   - 90-100: "A"
   - 80-89: "B"
   - 70-79: "C"
   - 60-69: "D"
   - Below 60: "F"
3. After assigning a grade, print a message stating the grade.

## Sample Output:

```
