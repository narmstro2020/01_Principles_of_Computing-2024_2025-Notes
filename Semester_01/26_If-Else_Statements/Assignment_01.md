# Assignment 1: Age-Based Activity Recommendation

**Objective:** Practice using `if-elif-else` statements by creating a program that suggests activities based on age.

## Instructions:

1. Create a Python program that asks the user for their age.
2. Based on the age entered, the program should recommend activities using the following conditions:
   - If the user is under 5 years old, print: "You should play with toys."
   - If the user is between 5 and 12 years old, print: "You can play outdoor games."
   - If the user is between 13 and 17 years old, print: "You might enjoy video games."
   - If the user is 18 or older, print: "You can try hiking or traveling."

## Sample Output:

```
Enter your age: 15
You might enjoy video games.
```
