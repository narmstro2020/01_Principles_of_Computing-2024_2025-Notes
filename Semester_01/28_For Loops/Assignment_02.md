### **Assignment 2: Pattern Printing**
Create a program that uses nested `for` loops to print the following pattern:

```
*
* *
* * *
* * * *
* * * * *
```

**Steps**:
1. Use an outer `for` loop to determine the number of rows (5 in this case).
2. Use an inner `for` loop to print stars (`*`) based on the current row number.

**Expected Output**:
The program should print the following pattern exactly as shown above.
