### **Assignment 1: Sum of Even Numbers**
Write a program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive) using a `for` loop.

**Steps**:
1. Use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to 100.
2. Inside the loop, check if a number is even.
3. If it is, add it to a running total.

**Expected Output**:
The program should print:  
```
Sum of even numbers from 1 to 100 is: 2550
```
