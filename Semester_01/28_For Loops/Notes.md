# Python `for` Loop Tutorial

In Python, the `for` loop allows you to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) and execute a block of code multiple times. Here's a breakdown of how the `for` loop works, followed by some practical assignments to help solidify your understanding.

## 1. Basic `for` Loop Syntax
The `for` loop syntax in Python looks like this:

```python
for item in sequence:
    # Code to execute on each iteration
```

- **`item`**: This is a variable that takes the value of each element in the sequence.
- **`sequence`**: This is the collection youâ€™re iterating over, such as a list, tuple, string, etc.

For example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**Output**:
```
apple
banana
cherry
```

## 2. Using `range()` with `for` Loop

The `range()` function is commonly used in `for` loops. It generates a sequence of numbers, which can be specified as a start, stop, and optional step.

```python
for i in range(5):  # Loops from 0 to 4
    print(i)
```

**Output**:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

You can also specify a start and step value:

```python
for i in range(1, 10, 2):
    print(i)
```

**Output**:
```
1
3
5
7
9
```

## 3. Nested `for` Loops

You can also nest `for` loops inside one another. This is useful when you want to loop through multiple sequences.

```python
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
shapes = ["circle", "square", "triangle"]

for color in colors:
    for shape in shapes:
        print(color, shape)
```

**Output**:
```
red circle
red square
red triangle
green circle
green square
green triangle
blue circle
blue square
blue triangle
```
