# Assignment 1: Basic List Operations

## Instructions

1. **List Creation and Indexing**
   - Create a list named `color_list` with the following elements: `"red"`, `"green"`, `"blue"`, `"yellow"`.
   - Print the first and last elements of `color_list` using indexing.
   - Using slicing, create a new list `slice_list` containing only the second and third elements of `color_list` and print it.

2. **List Methods**
   - Create a list named `num_list` with the values `[4, 6, 4, 2, 9, 4, 1]`.
   - Use the `append()` method to add the number `5` to `num_list` and print the updated list.
   - Use the `remove()` method to remove the first occurrence of the number `4` from `num_list` and print the updated list.
   - Use the `count()` method to count how many times the number `4` appears in `num_list`.
   - Use the `index()` method to find the position of the first occurrence of the number `9` in `num_list`.

3. **List Mutability**
   - Create a list called `fruit_list` with the values `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`.
   - Change the second element from `"banana"` to `"orange"` and print the modified list.
   - Use the `pop()` method to remove the last element of `fruit_list` and print the updated list.

**Submission**: Write a Python script that performs all tasks above and add comments explaining each step.
